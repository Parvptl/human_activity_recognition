# Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Using Smartphone Sensors

## Project Objective

This project aims to build a robust machine learning system capable of classifying human physical activities (e.g., Walking, Sitting, Standing) based on raw sensor data from a smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope.

The project will follow a comprehensive machine learning workflow, covering everything from initial data analysis and model comparison to advanced techniques like PCA for feature visualization and HMM for sequential analysis, as outlined in the course syllabus.

## Dataset

This project will use the **UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset**. This dataset contains pre-processed time-series data from 30 subjects, making it ideal for both classification and sequential modeling tasks.

## Proposed Tech Stack

* Language: Python

* Core Data Libraries: Pandas (for data manipulation), NumPy (for numerical operations)

*Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (for all your models, from Logistic Regression to PCA)

*Data Visualization: Matplotlib & Seaborn (for creating plots in your notebooks)

*Web Application: Streamlit (for building the interactive user interface)

*Model Persistence: Joblib (for saving and loading your trained scikit-learn model)
